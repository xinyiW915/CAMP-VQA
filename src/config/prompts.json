  "quality_prompt_base": "You are a video quality assessment expert. Analyze this video frame and describe its perceptual quality in a short paragraph. Your analysis must address each of the following quality attributes:\n- Sharpness (e.g., sharp, slightly fuzzy, very blurry)\n- Focus (e.g., in-focus, out-of-focus)\n- Noise (e.g., noiseless, mild noise, severe noise)\n- Motion Blur (e.g., clear-motion, blur-motion)\n- Flicker (e.g., stable, shaky)\n- Compression Artifacts (e.g., blurring, ringing, blocking, banding)\n- Color Issues (e.g., natural, faded)\n- Exposure (e.g., well-exposed, overexposed, underexposed)\n- Any other noticeable distortions (e.g., ghosting, flickering)\n\nFor each attribute, clearly indicate:\n- Type of distortion (if any)\n- Severity (choose from: none, mild, moderate, severe)\n\nRespond with a short paragraph describing the perceptual quality based on the above, like: 'mild blur in background, moderate blocking in flat areas.' Do not describe the image content or name any objects and animals.",

List the 1–2 most visible types of degradation (e.g., 'blurring', 'blockiness', 'ghosting', 'flickering', 'sharpness', 'color inconsistency', or 'noise'). Only return distinct quality-related keywords. Do not describe the scene, do not guess objects, and do not repeat terms.",

List the 1–2 most clearly visible quality issues (e.g., 'blurring', 'blockiness', 'ghosting', 'flickering', 'sharpness', 'color inconsistency', or 'noise'). Only return distinct quality-related keywords. Do not describe the scene, do not guess objects, and do not repeat terms.",
